# PARASOL FIT INDEX (PFI)
## Company & Stakeholder Scoring Framework

---

## Core Philosophy

Like WAR in baseball, PFI answers one question: **"How much value can we create together, and how likely are we to realize it?"**

PFI combines observable company attributes with relationship context to predict partnership success.

---

## PFI Architecture

| Component | Elements |
|-----------|----------|
| **Company-Level PFI** | Maturity, Runway, PMF Stage, Economics, Operational Readiness, Urgency |
| **Stakeholder-Level PFI** | Authority, Pain Ownership, Political Capital, Stability |
| **Service Fit Matrix** | Primary Service, Secondary Service, Future Opportunity |
| **Expansion Potential** | Service Breadth, Growth Trajectory, Relationship Depth, Referenceable Value |

---

# PART 1: COMPANY-LEVEL PFI

## 1. Company Maturity & Stability (Weight: 15%)

Measures predictability of behavior based on age and ownership structure.

| Signal | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| <1 year, concentrated founder ownership | 4 | High upside, high risk |
| 1-3 years, seed/angel cap table | 6 | Finding footing |
| 3-5 years, institutional investors, clean cap table | 9 | Ideal maturity |
| 5-10 years, messy cap table or unclear control | 5 | Red flag regardless of age |
| 10+ years, stable ownership, proven management | 10 | Maximum stability |

---

## 2. Financial Health / Runway (Weight: 20%)

Measures capacity to invest and financial planning maturity.

### Runway Scoring

| Runway Estimate | Score | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|-------|
| <6 months | 0 | Survival mode |
| 6-12 months | 2 | Constrained |
| 12-18 months | 5 | Manageable |
| 18-24 months | 7 | Comfortable |
| 24+ months or profitable | 10 | Strong position |

### Finance Team Structure Modifier

| Finance Organization | Modifier | Signal |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| No finance function, CEO handles everything | -2 | Too early |
| Finance reports directly to CEO, no dedicated team | -1 | Limited bandwidth |
| Finance leader + small team, clear reporting line | +1 | Mature planning |
| CFO/VP Finance + team, documented revenue goals | +2 | Strong governance |

---

## 3. Market Demand / PMF Trajectory (Weight: 20%)

Where are they in the technology adoption lifecycle? The "tornado" phase is where Parasol creates the most value.

| Stage | Score | Parasol Fit |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Pre-product, idea stage | 0 | Too early |
| Product exists, searching for PMF | 2 | Premature |
| Early adopters, signs of pull | 5 | Emerging opportunity |
| Crossing chasm - early majority traction | 10 | **IDEAL - tornado phase** |
| Late majority / mainstream | 6 | Optimization mode |
| Mature/declining market | 2 | Margin pressure |

---

## 4. Revenue Potential / Deal Economics (Weight: 20%)

Focus on Parasol's net earnings, not just top-line deal value.

| Parasol Net Earnings | Score | Notes |
|---------------------|-------|-------|
| <$5K | 2 | Minimal return |
| $5K - $15K | 4 | Worth considering |
| $15K - $30K | 6 | Solid opportunity |
| $30K - $50K | 8 | Strong opportunity |
| $50K+ | 10 | Priority pursuit |

---

## 5. Operational Readiness (Weight: 10%)

Can they actually work with you? Infrastructure gaps = higher cost, longer ramp.

| Readiness Signal | Score | Impact |
|------------------|-------|--------|
| No CRM, no process, no content | 2 | Building from scratch |
| Basic CRM, informal process | 4 | Foundation exists |
| CRM in place, some documentation | 6 | Can accelerate |
| CRM + documented process + content exists | 8 | Ready to optimize |
| Full stack: CRM, process, content, bandwidth to collaborate | 10 | Ideal partner |

---

## 6. Urgency / Forcing Function (Weight: 15%)

Without urgency, even high-fit deals drift. What's creating pressure to act now?

| Urgency Signal | Score | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| Board mandate / investor pressure with deadline | 10 | External accountability |
| Missed revenue targets (last 1-2 quarters) | 9 | Pain is fresh |
| New funding with growth expectations | 8 | Money + expectations |
| Competitive threat (losing deals to rival) | 7 | Fear motivates |
| New sales/rev leader hired (proving themselves) | 7 | Career pressure |
| Founder "feeling" the pain, no external pressure | 4 | Can deprioritize |
| "Exploring options" / "planning for next year" | 2 | No forcing function |

**Modifier:** Inbound from content/referral = +2 (self-selected urgency)

---

## Company-Level PFI Formula

```
Company PFI = (Maturity × 0.15) + (Runway × 0.20) + (PMF × 0.20) + (Economics × 0.20) + (Readiness × 0.10) + (Urgency × 0.15)
```

---

# PART 2: STAKEHOLDER-LEVEL PFI

Score each stakeholder independently. A deal often has 2-4 key players - understanding the mix matters as much as individual scores.

## 1. Decision Authority (Weight: 30%)

**What it measures:** Can this person actually say yes and make it stick?

| Score | Level | Signals |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 10 | **Final decision maker** | Signs contracts, controls budget, no approval needed above |
| 8 | **Effective authority** | Needs nominal sign-off but recommendation is rubber-stamped |
| 6 | **Strong influencer** | Part of buying committee, carries significant weight |
| 4 | **Champion only** | Can advocate but needs to "sell up" internally |
| 2 | **Evaluator** | Gathering info, will hand off recommendation |
| 0 | **No authority** | Interested IC, no buying role |

**Red flags:** "I'll need to run this by..." (without clarity); vague on budget ownership; title doesn't match apparent authority

---

## 2. Pain Ownership (Weight: 25%)

**What it measures:** Does this person personally feel the problem you solve?

| Score | Level | Signals |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 10 | **Accountable for the number** | Their comp/job tied to metrics you impact |
| 8 | **Directly responsible** | Owns the function, feels daily pain |
| 6 | **Shares ownership** | Part of their remit but not sole owner |
| 4 | **Adjacent pain** | Affected by the problem but doesn't own the fix |
| 2 | **Intellectual interest** | Sees the problem, not their job to solve |
| 0 | **No connection** | Exploring on behalf of someone else |

### Ideal Pain Owners by Parasol Service

| Service | Ideal Pain Owner |
|---------|------------------|
| Deal Closing | Head of Sales, CRO, founder doing sales |
| Account Expansion | CS leader, AM lead, CRO |
| Demand Gen | Marketing leader, Growth, founder |
| Thought Leadership | CEO/founder, CMO |
| Advisory | CEO, CRO, board member |
| Rev Ops | Rev Ops lead, Sales Ops, CRO |

---

## 3. Political Capital (Weight: 25%)

**What it measures:** Can they spend internal credibility to push this through?

| Score | Level | Signals |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 10 | **Founder/C-level with equity** | Ultimate skin in game, can force decisions |
| 8 | **Rising star** | Recent wins, building political momentum, trusted |
| 6 | **Established operator** | Respected, has credibility, picks battles wisely |
| 4 | **Neutral standing** | Neither rising nor falling, limited capital to spend |
| 2 | **On thin ice** | Recent misses, under scrutiny, risky to back |
| 0 | **New to org** | <6 months, no track record, no capital yet |

**Why this matters:** High authority + low capital = can say yes but might get overruled. You need someone who can spend credibility on your engagement.

---

## 4. Tenure & Stability (Weight: 20%)

**What it measures:** Will they be there to see this through?

| Score | Level | Signals |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 10 | **Founder or long-tenured exec** | 3+ years, deeply embedded, not going anywhere |
| 8 | **Stable and committed** | 1-3 years, clear growth path at company |
| 6 | **Reasonably stable** | 1+ year, no red flags |
| 4 | **New but invested** | <1 year but hired to fix this problem |
| 2 | **Flight risk** | Signs of job searching, company instability |
| 0 | **Interim/contractor** | Temporary role, no long-term stake |

**Watch for:** LinkedIn activity (updating profile); company layoffs/restructuring; leadership churn; how they talk about future ("when we..." vs "if I'm still...")

---

## Stakeholder PFI Formula

```
Stakeholder PFI = (Authority × 0.30) + (Pain × 0.25) + (Capital × 0.25) + (Stability × 0.20)
```

---

## Stakeholder Mix Analysis

Beyond individual scores, assess the buying committee composition:

| Scenario | Risk | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| High-authority champion + high-pain owner (same person) | Low | Accelerate |
| High-authority but low-pain | Medium | Find the pain owner, get them involved |
| High-pain but low-authority | Medium | Coach them to bring in decision maker |
| Multiple stakeholders, aligned | Low | Solidify consensus |
| Multiple stakeholders, misaligned | High | Identify blocker, address or walk |
| Single-threaded (one contact only) | High | Expand contacts before proposal |

---

# PART 3: SERVICE FIT MATRIX

Score fit for each service independently, then surface the best entry point.

| Service | High Fit (7-10) | Medium Fit (4-6) | Low Fit (0-3) |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Deal Closing - SMB** | Pipeline >50 opps, no dedicated closers, founder-led hitting ceiling | Some pipeline, part-time sales effort | No pipeline, pre-PMF |
| **Deal Closing - MM** | $25-100K deals, 2-4 month cycles, reps missing quota | Inconsistent pipeline, unclear ICP | Deals too small or too enterprise |
| **Deal Closing - Ent** | Named accounts engaged, complex multi-threading, $100K+ deals | Some enterprise interest, no motion yet | No enterprise ambition or readiness |
| **Account Expansion** | Existing customers, no expansion playbook, NRR <100% | Customers exist, some organic expansion | No customer base yet |
| **Demand Gen** | Product ready, sales team idle, top-of-funnel dry | Some inbound but inconsistent | Product not ready for volume |
| **Thought Leadership** | Founder has POV but no platform, entering competitive market | Some content, needs amplification | No differentiated story to tell |
| **Advisory** | Strategic crossroads, scaling decisions pending, need outside lens | General "we should talk strategy" | Tactical problems only |
| **Rev Ops** | >5 reps, systems duct-taped, data unreliable, scaling pain | Some process, needs optimization | Too early, <3 reps |

### Service Fit Output Format

```
PRIMARY FIT:    Deal Closing (MM) - 8/10
SECONDARY FIT:  Rev Ops - 6/10
FUTURE UPSIDE:  Account Expansion - when customer base matures
```

---

# PART 4: EXPANSION POTENTIAL

Predicts lifetime value, not just first engagement.

| Factor | Score Range | What to Look For |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Service Breadth Fit** | 1 service = 2 \| 2-3 services = 5 \| 4+ services = 9 | How many Parasol services could they eventually use? |
| **Growth Trajectory** | Flat = 1 \| 10-30% = 4 \| 30-100%+ = 9 | Will they scale into more needs? |
| **Relationship Depth** | Single contact = 2 \| 2-3 = 6 \| Exec + operators = 9 | Multi-threaded or single champion? |
| **Referenceable Potential** | Unlikely = 2 \| Possible = 5 \| High-profile = 9 | Will this become a case study / referral source? |

### Expansion Score Formula

```
Expansion Score = (Breadth × 0.30) + (Growth × 0.30) + (Depth × 0.20) + (Reference × 0.20)
```

# PART 5: DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

Questions to naturally surface PFI signals in conversation.

## Company-Level Discovery
